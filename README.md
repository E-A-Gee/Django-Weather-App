# Django Weather App

A weather app that displays the weather for a given location using either the user's IP address using the ipware package, or a search value.

I used two tutorials to guide me. One was a Javascript tutorial which was the basis of the app layout and format.

The other was more specific to creating a weather app in Django. 

I added a searchbar so that users can change the location they'd like to view weather for.
